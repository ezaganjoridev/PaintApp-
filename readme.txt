Our Paint app is aimed to implement a very simple intuitive
UI that is easy for end users to use. We feature consistent 
Icons throughout to make it easier for the user to understand
what each button does. We provide the USER with feedback on what
each item does. We have implemented many features for our paint
app and the feature list goes as follows :

a) Pencil - thin brush
b) Brush - 3 levels of brushes with pop up menu to choose between
strokes
c) Load an image
i) modify image by stretching
zooming, or displacing.
d) Word Art
e) Color picker for burshes, wordArt
f) Fill in background 
g) Eraser
h) Draw single lines
i) Draw squares/rectangles
i) this includes filled squares/rectangles/translucent 
j) draw smooth/round edged rectangles/squares
i) this includes filled smooth edged shapes/translucent 
k) draw circles
i) this includes filled circles/translucent 
l) undo method, and a redo method
m) zoom feature for canvas if time permits.

Make note of special details paid to for example the menu
bars where icons are also loaded, and the options are classified
to make it more easy for use. 
This paint app aims to use simple interactions to achieve most
usability.
